# picoCTF
My experience on the CTF challenge was how I could archive the flags.

Solutions for the CTF Challenge  Write-ups and solutions to several CTF problems I resolved are available in this repository.  Below is a high-level summary and technique for each challenge, arranged by category. In the conclusion, I've given links to screenshots and terminal output that explain the solution more thoroughly.
